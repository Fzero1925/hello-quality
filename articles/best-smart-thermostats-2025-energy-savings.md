## Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation and Compatibility

**Q: How do I know if my home is compatible with a smart thermostat?**
A: Most homes built after 1990 with central heating/cooling are compatible. Check for existing thermostat wires (usually 4-8 wires) and 24V HVAC systems. Use manufacturer compatibility tools online, or consult with an HVAC professional for complex systems.

**Q: What is a C-wire and do I need one?**
A: A C-wire (common wire) provides continuous power to smart thermostats. While many newer models work without one using alternative power methods, a C-wire ensures reliable operation. Most thermostats include workaround solutions or power adapters.

**Q: Can I install a smart thermostat myself?**
A: Yes, most homeowners can install basic smart thermostats. The process typically takes 1-2 hours with manufacturer apps providing step-by-step guidance. Professional installation is recommended for complex HVAC systems or if you're uncomfortable working with electrical components.

### Features and Performance

**Q: How much money can I actually save with a smart thermostat?**
A: Average savings range from 10-23% on heating and cooling costs. For a typical home spending $1,200 annually on HVAC, this translates to $120-280 in savings. Actual savings depend on your home's efficiency, local energy costs, and usage patterns.

**Q: Do smart thermostats work during power outages?**
A: Smart thermostats require power to operate. Most have backup batteries that maintain settings for a few hours, but extended outages will require manual restart once power returns. Some models remember your schedule and resume normal operation automatically.

**Q: How accurate are learning algorithms?**
A: Modern learning thermostats achieve 85-95% accuracy in predicting your preferences within 1-2 weeks. They continuously adapt to changes in your routine. Manual overrides help train the system faster and improve long-term accuracy.

### Maintenance and Troubleshooting

**Q: What regular maintenance do smart thermostats need?**
A: Minimal maintenance required - mainly keeping the display clean and ensuring stable Wi-Fi connectivity. Replace HVAC filters regularly as clogged filters reduce efficiency. Software updates are typically automatic.

**Q: What should I do if my smart thermostat goes offline?**
A: First, check your Wi-Fi network and restart your router. Restart the thermostat by removing it from the wall plate for 30 seconds. If problems persist, check for app updates or contact manufacturer support.

**Q: How long do smart thermostats last?**
A: Quality smart thermostats typically last 8-12 years with regular use. Electronic components may outlast mechanical parts in traditional thermostats. Most manufacturers offer 2-5 year warranties with extended warranty options available.
